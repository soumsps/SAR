Self Attendance Register
--------------
Introduction
--------------
This project aims to help students for maintaining their own attendance report. In
universities 75% attendance of student is the main criteria for allowing him/her in
semester exams, but many times due to carelessness of students he/she does not attend
sufficient number of classes. So by maintaining their own attendance report on daily
basis he/she will be able to keep track of their own percentage attendance till date.

The project “Self Attendance Register” is aimed to help students to keep their daily
records. Its better than traditional paper attendance report, as it automatically
calculates percentage attendance of student on daily basis. There is no need to count
and calculate percentage daily on calculator, like it was required in traditional paper
register, Software will do this task automatically. He/She will also be able to set
remarks on every attended class, remarks can be anything ( for eg: topics taught, any
important questions asked by any other student of class). He/she will be also able to
view date wise attendance with remarks too.
